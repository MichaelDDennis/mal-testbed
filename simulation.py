# Simulate is the Main function we will be studying, the structure here is meant to force isolation between
# different parts of the code base so it is easier to tell what is going on and who knows about who.
#
# One specific way in which this helps avoid confusion is in the separating the game itself from how they
# update their models.  Though both will have similar structure, one will be in the agents head and the
# other will be in the real world.  Only the first needs to be differentiable and they need not always match.
#
# I also made this a streaming iterator so that interaction with it is easier and analysis of results can be seen
# as soon as possible.
#
# For clarity, the types of all of the arguments are as follows:
#
# Initial State: State
# Dyn: State x ActA x ActB --> State
# ObsA: State -> ObsA
# ObsB: State -> ObsB
#
# A: Agent
# B: Agent
